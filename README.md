# Android-Application

Guess the celebrity is the application which randomly shows a celebrity Image with four options. The user has to guess the celebrity from the given four options. If the user selects correct option then the application shows toast message as correct otherwise it shows as wrong along with the correct celebrity name. I have taken the celebrity images from http://www.posh24.com/celebrities using AsyncTask download service of android. This application requires internet connection to work.
